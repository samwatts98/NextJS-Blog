# NextJS-Blog
Getting familiar with NextJS, SSR and SSG! This repo uses demo data from my Haiku Generator repository as well as gibberish Markdown to demonstrate pages being rendered from various data sources (.json &amp; .md)!

# Todo!
> Actually style this with styled-components, currently a skeleton.
> Integrate data source fetching with an API, no more fake data.
> Better navigation / content.
> Utilise more aspects of the NextJS framework for personal development.
